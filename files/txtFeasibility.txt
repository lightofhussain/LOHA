Feasibility study

Conducting a feasibility study for an investment property project involves evaluating various factors to determine whether the investment will be profitable. Here's a structured approach to assessing the feasibility of an investment property project:

Market Analysis
1.	Demand and Supply: Analyse the current demand and supply in the local real estate market. 
2.	Look at: vacancy rates, rental rates, and absorption rates.
3.	Target Market: Identify the target demographic for the property. This could be based on age, income level, family size, etc.
4.	Trends: Consider market trends, such as economic conditions, employment rates, population growth, and future developments in the area.

Location Analysis
5.	Neighbourhood: Evaluate the neighbourhoodâ€™s desirability, safety, schools, amenities, and infrastructure.
6.	Accessibility: Check the accessibility to major roads, public transport, and commercial areas.
7.	Zoning and Regulations: Understand local zoning laws and any regulations that might affect the property use.

Financial Analysis
1.	Purchase Price: Determine the acquisition cost of the property.
2.	Renovation/Development Costs: Estimate the costs of any required renovations or developments.
3.	Operating Expenses: Calculate ongoing expenses such as property management, maintenance, insurance, and property taxes.
4.	Financing: Assess the financing options, including interest rates, loan terms, and down payment requirements.

Revenue Projections
1.	Rental Income: Estimate potential rental income based on comparable properties in the area.
2.	Occupancy Rates: Project expected occupancy rates and how they may fluctuate over time.
3.	Additional Income: Consider other sources of income, such as parking fees, laundry services, or storage rentals.

Return on Investment (ROI)
1.	Net Operating Income (NOI): Calculate NOI by subtracting operating expenses from rental income.
2.	Cap Rate: Determine the capitalization rate to compare the investment with others in the market.
3.	Cash Flow Analysis: Analyse the cash flow to ensure the property can cover debt service and provide a profit.
4.	Payback Period: Estimate the time required to recoup the initial investment.
5.	Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Calculate IRR to evaluate the profitability over the investment period.

Risk Assessment
1.	Market Risk: Assess risks related to market fluctuations and economic downturns.
2.	Property Risk: Evaluate risks associated with the property's physical condition and potential for obsolescence.
3.	Tenant Risk: Consider the risk of tenant turnover and the ability to attract and retain tenants.
4.	Legal and Regulatory Risks: Identify any legal or regulatory risks that could impact the investment.

Exit Strategy
1.	Selling the Property: Plan for the eventual sale of the property, including potential market conditions and target buyers.
2.	Holding Period: Determine the optimal holding period for maximizing returns.
3.	Alternative Strategies: Consider other exit strategies, such as refinancing or converting the property to a different use.


Example Feasibility Study
Here is a simplified example of a feasibility study for a residential rental property:

1. Market Analysis: High demand for rental units in a growing urban area with low vacancy rates.

2. Location Analysis: Located in a desirable neighbourhood with good schools, amenities, and public transport.

3. Financial Analysis:
    Purchase Price: $500,000
    Renovation Costs: $50,000
    Operating Expenses: $20,000/year
    Financing: 20% down payment, 4% interest rate, 30-year loan

4. Revenue Projections:
    Rental Income: $3,000/month
    Occupancy Rate: 95%

5. ROI:
    NOI: $3,000 * 12 * 0.95 - $20,000 = $15,200/year
    Cap Rate: $15,200 / $550,000 = 2.76%
    Cash Flow: Positive after debt service
    Payback Period: Approximately 4 years (excluding financing costs)
    IRR: Calculate based on cash flow projections over the holding period

6. Risk Assessment: Moderate market risk, low property and tenant risk, manageable legal risks.

7. Exit Strategy: Plan to sell after 10 years when market conditions are favourable, or consider refinancing if interest rates drop.
